# Practice-C-Programs
Practice programs written in C
Welcome to the Practice-C-Programs Repository!

Goal of this repo: To create and upload basic and advanced C code that can be applied in real life situations

The process of developing my code involves the following steps:
1. Observe and identify a problem or potential problem that can be solved through code
2. Create a logical process sheet or diagram to explain how the code works
3. Write the code
4. Test the code
5. Do some debugging
6. Update the code to improve aesthetics

In the following weeks, months and years I will be uploading my code to the repo as a record of my journey as an avid learner and admirer of the C programming language.
